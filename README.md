#colwm

colwm is an window manager for macOS forked from the popular AeroSpace tiling window manager

## Key features

- Tiling window manager based on a [tree paradigm](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#tree)
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) inspired
- Fast workspaces switching without animations and without the necessity to disable SIP
- AeroSpace employs its [own emulation of virtual workspaces](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces) instead of relying on native macOS Spaces due to [their considerable limitations](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces)
- Plain text configuration (dotfiles friendly). See: [default-config.toml](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#default-config)
- CLI first (manpages and shell completion included)
- Doesn't require disabling SIP (System Integrity Protection)
- [Proper multi-monitor support](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#multiple-monitors) (i3-like paradigm)

## Installation

Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to get autoupdates (Preferred)

```
brew install --cask nikitabobko/tap/aerospace
```

In multi-monitor setup please make sure that monitors [are properly arranged](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#proper-monitor-arrangement).

> [!NOTE]
> By using AeroSpace, you acknowledge that it's not [notarized](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution).
>
> Notarization is a "security" feature by Apple.
> You send binaries to Apple, and they either approve them or not.
> In reality, notarization is about building binaries the way Apple likes it.
>
> I don't have anything against notarization as a concept.
> I specifically don't like the way Apple does notarization.
> I don't have time to deal with Apple.
>
> [Homebrew installation script](https://github.com/nikitabobko/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Casks/aerospace.rb) is configured to
> automatically delete `com.apple.quarantine` attribute, that's why the app should work out of the box, without any warnings that
> "Apple cannot check AeroSpace for malicious software"

## Tip of the day

```bash
defaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool true
```

Now, you can move windows by holding `ctrl`+`cmd` and dragging any part of the window (not necessarily the window title)
